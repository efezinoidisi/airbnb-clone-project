A simple booking and management system using AirBnB as a case study. This system will have a simple but lovely UI/UX that allows users to perform basic functionalities.

At the end of this program, I will have developed adequate knowledge and skills to implement any type of system. I will:

- Understand the project scope.
- Identify key features to be implemented.
- Adhere to designated timelines and milestones.
- Utilize the necessary tools and technologies.
- Fulfill my roles and responsibilities within the project.

## Tech Stack

- <strong>Frontend</strong>: React with TypeScript, Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation, TailwindCSS for styling.

- <strong>Backend</strong>: Python, Django, and MySQL (the backend is not the primary focus).

- <strong>Other Tools</strong>: Redux or Context API for state management, REST for API integration and Jest for testing.

## UI/UX Design Planning

A user-friendly design is important in a booking system in order to help users easily navigate the interface and perform basic functionalities.

The design goals for this project are as follows:

### Features

The key features to be implemented include:

- <strong>Property Listings</strong>: Display properties with relevant details and images.

- <strong>Booking System</strong>: Allow users to book properties, view booking details, and manage bookings.
